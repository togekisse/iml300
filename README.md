[the house](https://togekisse.github.io/iml300/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web experience that represents the haunted house as an uncanny valley of memory.

### Description

In gothic horror, the haunted house is a living entity, as much a participant of narrative as the disturbed inhabitant themself. Based on Flash walking simulators, bleary dreamscapes, and Gregor Schneider's architectural installations, <i>the house</i> exhumes how we conceptualize and narrativize space. The user navigates between pages by clicking on the arrow buttons of a directional compass. Each page displays a single black-and-white image of rural suburbia, but the images are not sourced from a particular house or geographic location. As the user travels back and forth between pages, the disparate images coalesce into the titular house itself, and multiple narratives emerge to further connect the closed neighborhood loop. Meanwhile GIF, animated text, and embedded atmospheric sound suggest the parallel existence of an other.
